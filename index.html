ANASTASIA
Is this the class for writing musicals?
CHRISTINE
What? No ‚Äì this is the playwriting seminar.
ANASTASIA
That‚Äôs it.
CHRISTINE
Oh, I‚Äôm sorry, I thought you said musicals.
ANASTASIA
Didn‚Äôt you get the email?
(At this moment, the teacher, Perry, arrives, followed
immediately by Helen. Perry conducts the class standing ‚Äì
he is very animated.)
PERRY
Hello, class. By way of introduction, I‚Äôd like to go around the room. Each of you should
introduce yourselves and give a short synopsis of the piece you are writing.
(He nods to Helen, who is still getting settled.)
PERRY
Me? Oh, okay. Well, I‚Äôm Helen. I‚Äôm an accountant. I took a course on accounting
ethics last year, and one of the case studies was just fascinating, I thought it would make
a great play. It‚Äôs about the use of stock options in CEO compensation.
(Perry nods to Christine next.)
CHRISTINE
I am Christine. I am a Professor of History at the University, where I specialize in the
History of Anthropology. My play is a one-woman show about an anthropologist who is
in her eighteenth month observing apes in the African jungle without any human contact.
It takes place entirely inside her tent, and mostly inside her head.
PERRY
Okay.
